h1. DTResurrectionKit

DTResurrectionKit is a small cocoa framework for resurrecting an object graph, specifically designed with a view controller structure on the iPhone.

*WARNING* DTResurrectionKit 1.1 moves the location of all of the classes in the project to the root. It also removes the debug mode which is now in a separate branch called debug. This should only be used to debug and not to put into production apps. I have split it into a separate branch to make this distinction and because it also includes images that won't be used for release.

h2. Branch Structure

There are two branches to this repository, *master* and *production*, these are described below. (Thanks to "Abizer":https://github.com/Abizern for showing me this method and for his initial writeup below.)

h3. The master Branch

The master branch contains the class extension files as well as an Xcode project that demonstrates the code and is the branch to use to see how to use the code. It as also the branch that further development of the code should be performed on.

h3. The production Branch

The production branch should be used if you want to add these extensions as a git submodule in other projects and will only contain the class files themselves without the Xcode project or example classes. This is preferable as it will keep your directories clean of any code which is unnecessary to your working project, of course you can switch branches in the submodule to access the given samples.

Changes made to the master branch will be merged across to production, so it will always remain current with respect to master.

To add the production branch rather than master, simply use the -b flag as shown below.

bc. git submodule add -b production git://github.com/danielctull/DTResurrectionKit.git

To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual

bc. git pull origin

h3. Artefacts

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to production. These are files that are ignored by git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf

h2. Examples

Examples of some of these features can be found in the iPhone app delegate.
